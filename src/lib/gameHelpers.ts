How to manage regular updates to a game screen?
- on browsers that support requestIdleCallback we can explicitly wait until there is nothing pending scheduling.
   - in this case we can in theory schedule as much as we want as long as we wait for idle between updates.
- on browsers that don't support that we would have to just set timeouts and hope we don't block meaningful things
  - can measure how long update actually takes and schedule timeout accordingly
   - min bound
    - if we want to not take up more than 1/4 of duty cycle we would need to set timeout to at least 3 times time to update
   - max bound
    - highest timeout we should set is based on framerate, 


Have one callback which is always called just to re-render the canvas etc.
every loop thing it just always gets called
second callback takes the time since last time it was called as input, 
- occasionally yields (it is a generator) to indicate it could stop there if needed.
  - requestIdleCallback gives timeRemaining, so at each yield point we check if we have run out of time.
  - if we reach end of updater with still more time we run render right away,
  - if we ran out of time then we schedule another wait until idle with a short timeout

EFFECTIVE COLLISION DETECTION
model each object as having a center and a radius, defined in a way where every point of the object that can
collide fits within a circle with center and radius. (so this wouldn't be the same as center of mass)
Then you can divide the whole grid into boxes with side length at least double the largest radius of object
with this definition each object could only collide with objects within it's own box or adjacent boxes.

Define a function which takes a list of objects with {x,y,r} yields pairs of objects that might collide
- then application code can handle detecting if they actually collide.
First go over all elements and find the box they fit into, if there aren't any items in that box then create a new box.
Then iterate over all boxes, for each one:
- check collision between all objects within the box
- also for half the touching boxes (since we go over all of them we need a way to visit each adjacent pairs)
  check collision between each object in both boxes.
