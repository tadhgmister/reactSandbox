 * Instead we want to setup a route so that if it just goes to index it will load song list
 * otherwise any specific song will try to load that song page.
 * - need song page to be setup to take uri info to determine what song to load
 * - will have song index to just load list of songs and display as links
 * - will have router component be the main one to route either appropriately.
